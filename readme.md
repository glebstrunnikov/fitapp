My little pet project - a mobile app for fitness tracking. Powered by Capacitor, Vue and Ionic framework.

An alternative to the telegram bot: https://github.com/glebstrunnikov/fitbot. The app and bot share the same database and an the information related to the user syncs between database-mobile app-telegram account. In order to use the app, you should first start the bot and than set your Telegram ID in the app.

Makes CRUD operations to the gym training schedule, shows videos of correct exercice performance (upd. now temporary doesn't).

Soon: authorisation via deep links, statistics etc.
